# ------AWS VPC

In this Project we dive extensively into Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to have a valuable perspective on the fundermentals of cloud networking.
We x-ray subnets,internet gateways, route tables and other components in a VPC with a view to understanding how VPCs serve as a foundation for building scalable, secure and interconnected cloud architecture.
We will create and configure these components to gain practical experience in configuring VPCs to meet specific network requirements and security best practices.
At the end of the project the network architecture will look like this.
